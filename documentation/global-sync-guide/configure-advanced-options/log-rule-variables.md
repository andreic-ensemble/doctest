# Log Rule Variables

To assist with troubleshooting, it can be helpful to log the local variables. Check the Log Rule Variables option to have the variables logged in: `{RLI_HOME}\vds_server\logs\sync_engine\sync_engine.log` on the RadiantOne node where the sync engine processor that is assigned for the pipeline is running. If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, a sync engine processor can be running on one or more nodes and the pipeline processing is distributed across them. Check for the `{RLI_HOME}\vds_server\logs\sync_engine\sync_engine.log` on each cluster node to find the correct log file. Or you can use the Global Sync tab to download the corresponding sync_engine.log file by selecting the topology and selecting **Configure** next to the pipeline. Select the **Apply** component and in the Log Viewer section, select the **Download** button.
