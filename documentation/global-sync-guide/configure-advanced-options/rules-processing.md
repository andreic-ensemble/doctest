# Rules Processing

The default behavior is to evaluate all rules that are configured in the order in which they are defined. If your synchronization needs dictate that once the actions associated with one rule are executed, no other rules need to be evaluated, choose the option to **Stop** processing other rules as soon as one rule's conditions match and select **OK**.
