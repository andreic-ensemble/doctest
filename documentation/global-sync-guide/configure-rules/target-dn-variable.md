# Target DN Variable

The target DN can either be automatically generated, or you can control the value manually. This is determined by the option selected for [Target DN Generation](../configure-advanced-options/target-dn-generation.md#target-dn-generation) in the ADVANCED OPTIONS section for the Rule Set. When the **Manual** option is selected, you see a Target DN Variable property in the BASIC INFORMATION section of the Rule. You need a [variable defined](../rules/configure-rule-variables.md#configure-rule-variables) that computes the value of the target DN before you can configure the Target DN Variable in the BASIC INFORMATION section as outlined below.

1.  For a selected rule, choose the **BASIC INFORMATION** tab.

2.  Select the variable that contains the target DN value from the **Target DN Variable** drop-down list. This list is populated with all variables you have defined.

3.  Select **OK**.
